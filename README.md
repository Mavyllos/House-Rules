House Rules - Don't be limited by the rules! House Rules gives you a place to track your board game house rules. Built as a solo project for the Galvanize Web Development Immersive Program.

## What is House Rules?

House Rules is a place to list your board game collection and track any house rules or errata for those games. It was developed and designed by G48 Web Development student Summer Barclay.

As my family and friends are huge fans of board gaming, the idea of House Rules came to me as a better way to keep track of any house rules that we might make after a heated arguement over the interpretation of a game card or rule.

### Features

Users can quickly add a new game to their collection, delete a game from their collection,  and add, edit, or delete in their own rules and errata for a game in their collection.
